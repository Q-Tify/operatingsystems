As it is my own words I want to be short and precise
the difference between virtual and physical address:

Physical address refers to real memory address located in the main memory unit.
Virtual address refers to address that is generated by the CPU during the execution of the program.

There can be more virtual addresses than physical.

Physical addresses cant be accessed by the user, virtual - can.

Virtual address is mapped to physical address.  

Physical addresses are limited amount, virtual - not.
