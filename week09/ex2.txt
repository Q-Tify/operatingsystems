hit/miss ratio = 0.142857

Due to the principle of time locality in first case hit/miss ratio is greater, because pages that were accessed recently are still in the table, giving a hit.

In second case I changed the amount of different pages(increased) and the time between accesses the same pages(increased), so I got more misses.
