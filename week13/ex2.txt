Theory covered three strategies of dealing with deadlocks:
Recovery, Prevention and Avoidance.

Recovery strategy lets the deadlock to happen and then take an attempt to fix the situation.
The problem can be fixed in 3 different ways:
1.Take away the preemptive resource that is used
2.Use rollback (it should take checkpoints to do it)
3.Kill a process causing the deadlock. (this method should be avoided)
The main disadvanteges are: it inherent pre-emption losses and requested resources are granted to processes whenever possible.


Prevention strategy
To prevent the deadlock 4 conditions should be satisfied:
1.Mutual Exclusion Condition
2.Hold-and-Wait Condition
3.No preemption Condition
4.Circular wait Condition
The main disadvantage of this method that it limits the number of resources a process is allowed to have.

Avoidance strategy is the best from others because it avoids the deadlock.
But it can be used only if certain information is available beforehand. (granting resource safe or not)
Also it requires smart scheduling algo.
